    <p>Hello! I'm just a 22 year old Madisonian who loves to learn about different cultures through their food. I love Madison because of the diverse food options we have here.</p><br>
    <p>In my free time, I like to play videogames on my PS4 or Nintendo Switch, surf Youtube videos, go on walks or hiking, spending time with family and friends, take care of my plant babies, shopping and overall, just having a good time with good company!</p><br>
    <p>I am currently a graphic designer/pre-flight specialist for the Department of Admin - Publishing and Distribution Center. Graphic designing has been a catalyst for my interest in coding. I found that I enjoy not only the designing aspect of CSS, but also highly interested in the magic behind completing a webpage using HTML and JavaScript.</p>
